    "## Summary of the Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that collects information about the level of pollution in rivers. This is done by the monitor taking 5 samples at different times during the day measured as a whole number of “colony forming units of bacteria” (CFU) per 100 ml of water. The program should use a for loop to ask for the 5 values as a whole number and then report the highest of those values and the average. Based on the highest value it should then indicate whether this is GOOD water quality, SUFFICIENT water quality or POOR water quality."

    "In order to tackle this question i created two interconnected methods: WaterQuality and AverageCalculation . For each individual method I will explain how the method functions and how it was tested to ensure its efficacy. In addition, i will provide information on how to run the entire program in jupyterLab. \n",

    "## <span style=\"color: blue;\">WaterQuality()</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functionality\n",
    "This method is called by the WaterQuality(); statement. The method uses a For Loop to ask the user the quality of the River across 5 different samples. It then takes these values and outputs the worst and average water quality alongside indicating if the overall waterquality is satisfactory or poor.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "This method is called by the WaterQuality(); statement. The method begins by defining a scanner object to read the user inputs. The method also declares several variables including SampleSize, WorstQuality and totalValue to keep track of the measurements. The method then uses a For loop which iterates 5 times and asks the user the quality of water for 5 samples. The worst quality is calculated by using the Math.max() function which calculates the highest value of the sample inputs and assigns the value to a int variable. The method also calculates the total value of all samples by adding each For loop sample to one another. The method then calls the AverageCalculation method and passes the total waterquality and sample size to it, storing the returned value as an integer. The method then uses IF and ELSE statements to deliberate whether the water quality status is good, sufficient or poor. It will then use print statements to output the worst water quality, average water quality and the status of the water to the user.\n"
