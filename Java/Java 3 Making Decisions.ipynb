    "#### Functionality\n",
    "This method is called by the ExamQuestion(); statement. The program ask the user to input their three individual module grades across two seperate examinations. It will then pass these grades to the CalculateGrade method and return a String value which corresponds to the grade achieved before outputting this variable to the user. The method will also pass these variables to the GradeComparison function which will determine, across the two examinations, which grade was better than the other. The method will recieve this value and using the CalculateGrade method call it will convert this value to its String value and output the highest grades achieved across the two exams to the user for each module. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "This method is called by the ExamQuestion(); statement. The method firstly creates a new scanner object which will be used to scan and record user inputs to variables. The method then asks the user to input their theory, dry run and programming grades for both the first exam and their second exam in order. The entered inputs are stored as variables and are passed individually to the CalculateGrade method which works would which grade the student has earned according to the entered integer values. The method then outputs to the user the grades earned for their initial examination and the second examination. Then the method passes values to the GradeComparison method which works out if one grade is better than another. The better grade is returned and converted from an integer value into a string by the CalculateGrade method before being stored in a seperate variable. The program then outputs the three highest grades achieved across both exams for each module.   \n"

    "This method is called within the ExamQuestion() method. The purpose of this method is to return the highest grade which is conversely the lowest integer of the pair.  The method works by taking two integer values, that are passed to it as parameters. The method then outputs the lowest value of both int values and returns this to the ExamQuestion() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "This method is called within the ExamQuestion() method. The method works by taking two integer values, that are passed to it as parameters. The method then uses an IF and Else statements to compare if the first value is larger than the second. If the value is larger than the second value then the second value is returned. However IF the second value is larger than the first value the first value is returned. Otherwise the program assumes that the grades are the same and returns the first value. The returned variable is passed back to the ExamQuestion() method. "
