    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 1 – G minus: Getting started: Input-Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Includes user Input fields to enter the pet name and interact with the pet.\n",
    "- Includes an output menu so users can select what they want to do with their pet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 2 – G: Making progress: Assignments and Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The program uses variables (petName, hunger, happiness,and interacts with them.\n",
    "-  Defines the PetStatus() method which returns whether or not the pet is Alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 3 – F: Getting there: Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Includes IF, ELSE statements. (Decision statements)\n",
    "- Defines a method called PetStatus() that takes arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 4 - D: Bare Pass: Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses while loops to loop through each round of the game.\n",
    "- Well-structured in to multiple methods that both take arguments and return results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 5 - C: Pass: Arrays and Loops inside loops\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses arrays for the pet attributes.\n",
    "- Uses arrays accessed with a loop.\n",
    "- Uses loops within loops.\n",
    "- Defines and uses methods including at least one that is passed and uses array arguments \r\n"
