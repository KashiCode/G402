    "Write a program that works out the statistics for the womens world cup. The program should calculate and display the average goals scored across each match and the average minutes per goal across each match. The program must also accept two inputs from the user, these include total goals and total matches played. In addition the program must be structured as a series of methods where the first method calls a series of others in turn. In addition the number of minutes in a match (90) MUST be stored in the program as a local final variable.next method."

The method then asks the User two questions, one about the total matches and one about the total goals. The scanner then saves the user input as a integer value to match and goal variables. The method will then call two functions in order, it will firstly call the GoalsCalculation method and pass matches and goals as parameters. After it will call the MinutesCalculation and pass the same parameteres. \n",
