    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 1 – G minus: Getting started: Input-Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Includes user Input fields to enter the pet name and interact with the pet.\n",
    "- Includes an output menu so users can select what they want to do with their pet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 2 – G: Making progress: Assignments and Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The program uses variables petName, hunger, happiness,and interacts with them.\n",
    "-  Defines the createNewPet method which returns a pet record. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 3 – F: Getting there: Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Includes IF, ELSE statements to decide whether the user wants to feed their pet, play with their pet etc. \n",
    "- Defines a method/s that takes arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 4 - D: Bare Pass: Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses while loops to loop through the main menu and the different interaction options for your pet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 5 - C: Pass: Arrays and Loops inside loops\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses arrays for the pet attributes and to store the game instructions. \n",
    "- Uses arrays accessed with a loop such as those which output the game instructions. \n",
    "- The program defines and uses multiple methods and passes arrays as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 6 - B: Satisfactory: Records\n",
    "\n",
    "- Includes the pet record which is defined as a special class with no methods just field definitions.\n",
    "- Clearly decomposed into multiple small methods doing distinct jobs that take arguments and return results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 7 - A: Merit: File I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "- File input and output allowing users to save a game or load a game.\n",
    "- All variables are defined in methods and have minimum scope.\n"
